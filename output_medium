I  Originally Approached Java As  Just Another Programming Language,  Which In Many Senses It Is.
But As Time Passed And I Studied It More Deeply, I Began To See That The Fundamental Intent Of This Language Was Different From Other Languages I Had Seen Up To That Point.
Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.

Programming Is About Managing Complexity: The Complexity Of The Problem You Want To Solve, Laid Upon The Complexity Of The Machine In Which It Is Solved. Because Of This Complexity, Most Of Our Programming Projects Fail. And Yet, Of All The Programming Languages Of Which I Am Aware, Almost None Have Gone All Out And Decided That Their Main Design Goal Would Be To Conquer The Complexity Of Developing And Maintaining Programs.1 Of Course, Many Language Design Decisions Were Made With Complexity In Mind, But At Some Point There Were Always Other Issues That Were Considered Essential To Be Added Into The Mix. Inevitably, Those Other Issues Are What Cause Programmers To Eventually  Hit The Wall  With That Language. For Example, C++ Had To Be Backwards-Compatible With C (To Allow Easy Migration For C Programmers), As Well As Efficient. Those Are Both Very Useful Goals And Account For Much Of The Success Of C++, But They Also Expose Extra Complexity That Prevents Some Projects From Being Finished (Certainly, You Can Blame Programmers And Management, But If A Language Can Help By Catching Your Mistakes, Why Shouldn T It?). As Another Example, Visual BASIC (VB) Was Tied To BASIC, Which Wasn T Really Designed To Be An Extensible Language, So All The Extensions Piled Upon VB Have Produced Some Truly Unmaintainable Syntax. Perl Is Backwards-Compatible With Awk, Sed, Grep, And Other Unix Tools It Was Meant To Replace, And As A Result It Is Often Accused Of Producing  Write-Only Code  (That Is, After A While You Can T Read It). On The Other Hand, C++, VB, Perl, And Other Languages Like Smalltalk Had Some Of Their Design Efforts Focused On The Issue Of Complexity And As A Result Are Remarkably Successful In Solving Certain Types Of Problems.
What Has Impressed Me Most As I Have Come To Understand Java Is That Somewhere In The Mix Of Sun S Design Objectives, It Seems That There Was A Goal Of Reducing Complexity For The Programmer. As If To Say,  We Care About Reducing The Time And Difficulty Of Producing Robust Code.  In The Early Days, This Goal Resulted In Code That Didn T Run Very Fast (Although This Has Improved Over Time), But It Has Indeed Produced Amazing Reductions In Development Time Half Or Less Of The Time That It Takes To Create An Equivalent C++ Program. This Result Alone Can Save Incredible Amounts Of Time And Money, But Java Doesn T Stop There. It Goes On To Wrap Many Of The Complex Tasks That Have Become Important, Such As Multithreading And Network Programming, In Language Features Or Libraries That Can At Times Make Those Tasks Easy. And Finally, It Tackles Some Really Big Complexity Problems: Cross-Platform Programs, Dynamic Code Changes, And Even Security, Each Of Which Can Fit On Your Complexity Spectrum Anywhere From  Impediment  To  Show-Stopper.  So Despite The Performance Problems That We Ve Seen, The Promise Of Java Is Tremendous: It Can Make Us Significantly More Productive Programmers.
In All Ways Creating The Programs, Working In Teams, Building User Interfaces To Communicate With The User, Running The Programs On Different Types Of Machines, And Easily Writing Programs That Communicate Across The Internet Java Increases The Communication Bandwidth Between People.
I Think That The Results Of The Communication Revolution May Not Be Seen From The Effects Of Moving Large Quantities Of Bits Around. We Shall See The True Revolution Because We Will All Communicate With Each Other More Easily: One-On-One But Also In Groups And As A Planet.
